The **[progressr]** package provides a minimal API for reporting progress updates in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).  The design is to separate the representation of progress updates from how they are presented.  What type of progress to signal is controlled by the developer.  How these progress updates are rendered is controlled by the end user.  For instance, some users may prefer visual feedback such as a horizontal progress bar in the terminal, whereas others may prefer auditory feedback.

Design motto:

> The developer is responsible for providing progress updates but it's only the end user who decides if, when, and how progress should be presented. No exceptions will be allowed.

## A simple example

Assume that we have a function `slow_sum()` for adding up the values in a vector.  It is so slow, that we like to provide progress updates to whoever might be interested in it.  With the **progressr** package, this can be done as:

```r
slow_sum <- function(x) {
  p <- progressr::progressor(along = x)
  sum <- 0
  for (kk in seq_along(x)) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    sum <- sum + x[kk]
    p(message = sprintf("Added %g", x[kk]))
  }
  sum
}
```

Note how there are _no_ arguments in the code that specifies how progress is presented.  The only task for the developer is to decide on where in the code it makes sense to signal that progress has been made.  As we will see next, it is up to the end user of this code to decide whether they want to receive progress updates or not, and, if so, in what format.


### Without reporting on progress

When calling this function as in:
```r
> y <- slow_sum(1:10)
> y
[1] 55
>
```
it will behave as any function and there will be no progress updates displayed.


### Reporting on progress

If we are only interested in progress for a particular call, we can do:

```r
> library(progressr)
> with_progress(y <- slow_sum(1:10))
  |====================                               |  40%
```

However, if we want to report on progress from _every_ call, wrapping the calls in `with_progress()` might become too cumbersome.  If so, we can enable the global progress handler:

```r
> library(progressr)
> handlers(global = TRUE)
```

so that progress updates are reported on wherever signaled, e.g.

```r
> y <- slow_sum(1:10)
  |====================                               |  40%
> y <- slow_sum(10:1)
  |========================================           |  80%
```

This requires R 4.0.0 or newer.  To disable this again, do:

```r
> handlers(global = FALSE)
```

In the below examples, we will assume `handlers(global = TRUE)` is already set.


## Customizing how progress is reported

The default is to present progress via `utils::txtProgressBar()`, which is available on all R installations.  To change the default, to, say, `progress_bar()` by the **[progress]** package, set:

```r
handlers("progress")
```
This progress handler will present itself as:
```r
> y <- slow_sum(1:10)
/ [================>--------------------------]  40% Added 4
```

To set the default progress handler, or handlers, in all your R sessions, call `progressr::handlers(...)` in your <code>~/.Rprofile</code> file.



### Auditory progress updates

Progress updates do not have to be presented visually. They can equally well be communicated via audio. For example, using:

```r
handlers("beepr")
```
will present itself as sounds played at the beginning, while progressing, and at the end (using different **[beepr]** sounds).  There will be _no_ output written to the terminal;
```r
> y <- slow_sum(1:10)
> y
[1] 55
>
```


### Concurrent auditory and visual progress updates

It is possible to have multiple progress handlers presenting progress updates at the same time.  For example, to get both visual and auditory updates, use:
```r
handlers("txtprogressbar", "beepr")
```


### Silence all progress

To silence all progress updates, use:

```r
handlers("void")
```


### Further configuration of progress handlers

Above we have seen examples where the `handlers()` takes one or more strings as input, e.g. `handlers(c("progress", "beepr"))`.  This is short for a more flexible specification where we can pass a list of handler functions, e.g.

```r
handlers(list(
  handler_progress(),
  handler_beepr()
))
```

With this construct, we can make adjustments to the default behavior of these progress handlers.  For example, we can configure the `format`, `width`, and `complete` arguments of `progress::progress_bar$new()`, and tell **beepr** to use a different `finish` sound and generate sounds at most every two seconds by setting:

```r
handlers(list(
  handler_progress(
    format   = ":spin :current/:total (:message) [:bar] :percent in :elapsed ETA: :eta",
    width    = 60,
    complete = "+"
  ),
  handler_beepr(
    finish   = "wilhelm",
    interval = 2.0
  )
))
```


## Sticky messages

As seen above, some progress handlers present the progress message as part of its output, e.g. the "progress" handler will display the message as part of the progress bar.  It is also possible to "push" the message up together with other terminal output.  This can be done by adding class attribute `"sticky"` to the progression signaled.  This works for several progress handlers that output to the terminal.  For example, with:

```r
slow_sum <- function(x) {
  p <- progressr::progressor(along = x)
  sum <- 0
  for (kk in seq_along(x)) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    sum <- sum + x[kk]
    p(sprintf("Step %d", kk), class = if (kk %% 5 == 0) "sticky", amount = 0)
    p(message = sprintf("Added %g", x[kk]))
  }
  sum
}
```
we get
```r
> handlers("txtprogressbar")
> y <- slow_sum(1:30)
Step 5
Step 10
  |====================                               |  43%
```

and

```r
> handlers("progress")
> y <- slow_sum(1:30)
Step 5
Step 10
/ [===============>--------------------------]  43% Added 13
```


## Use regular output as usual alongside progress updates

In contrast to other progress-bar frameworks, output from `message()`, `cat()`, `print()` and so on, will _not_ interfere with progress reported via **progressr**.  For example, say we have:

```r
slow_sqrt <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  lapply(xs, function(x) {
    message("Calculating the square root of ", x)
    Sys.sleep(2)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}
```

we will get:

```r
> library(progressr)
> handlers(global = TRUE)
> handlers("progress")
> y <- slow_sqrt(1:8)
Calculating the square root of 1
Calculating the square root of 2
- [===========>-----------------------------------]  25% x=2
```

This works because **progressr** will briefly buffer any output internally and only release it when the next progress update is received just before the progress is re-rendered in the terminal.  This is why you see a two second delay when running the above example.  Note that, if we use progress handlers that do not output to the terminal, such as `handlers("beepr")`, then output does not have to be buffered and will appear immediately.


_Comment_: When signaling a warning using `warning(msg, immediate. = TRUE)` the message is immediately outputted to the standard-error stream.  However, this is not possible to emulate when warnings are intercepted using calling handlers, which are used by `with_progress()`.  This is a limitation of R that cannot be worked around.  Because of this, the above call will behave the same as `warning(msg)` - that is, all warnings will be buffered by R internally and released only when all computations are done.


## Support for progressr elsewhere

Note that progression updates by **progressr** is designed to work out of the box for any iterator framework in R.  Below is an set of examples for the most common ones.


### Base R Apply Functions

```r
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- lapply(xs, function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
#  |====================                               |  40%
```


### The foreach package

```r
library(foreach)
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- foreach(x = xs) %do% {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  }
}

my_fcn(1:5)
#  |====================                               |  40%
```

### The purrr package

```r
library(purrr)
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- map(xs, function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
#  |====================                               |  40%
```


### The plyr package

```r
library(plyr)
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- llply(xs, function(x, ...) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
#  |====================                               |  40%
```

_Note:_ This solution does not involved the `.progress = TRUE` argument that **plyr** implements.  Because **progressr** is more flexible, and because `.progress` is automatically disabled when running in parallel (see below), I recommend to use the above **progressr** approach instead.  Having said this, as proof-of-concept, the **progressr** package implements support `.progress = "progressr"` if you still prefer the **plyr** way of doing it.


## Parallel processing and progress updates

The **[future]** framework, which provides a unified API for parallel and distributed processing in R, has built-in support for the kind of progression updates produced by the **progressr** package.  This means that you can use it with for instance **[future.apply]**, **[furrr]**, and **[foreach]** with **[doFuture]**, and **[plyr]** or **[BiocParallel]** with **doFuture**.  In contrast, _non-future_ parallelization methods such as **parallel**'s `mclapply()` and, `parallel::parLapply()`, and **foreach** adapters like **doParallel** do _not_ support progress reports via **progressr**.


### future_lapply() - parallel lapply()

Here is an example that uses `future_lapply()` of the **[future.apply]** package to parallelize on the local machine while at the same time signaling progression updates:

```r
library(future.apply)
plan(multisession)

library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("progress", "beepr")

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- future_lapply(xs, function(x, ...) {
    Sys.sleep(6.0-x)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
# / [================>-----------------------------]  40% x=2
```


### foreach() with doFuture

Here is an example that uses `foreach()` of the **[foreach]** package to parallelize on the local machine (via **[doFuture]**) while at the same time signaling progression updates:

```r
library(doFuture)
registerDoFuture()      ## %dopar% parallelizes via future
plan(multisession)

library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("progress", "beepr")

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- foreach(x = xs) %dopar% {
    Sys.sleep(6.0-x)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  }
}

my_fcn(1:5)
# / [================>-----------------------------]  40% x=2
```


### future_map() - parallel purrr::map()

Here is an example that uses `future_map()` of the **[furrr]** package to parallelize on the local machine while at the same time signaling progression updates:

```r
library(furrr)
plan(multisession)

library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("progress", "beepr")

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- future_map(xs, function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(6.0-x)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
# / [================>-----------------------------]  40% x=2
```

_Note:_ This solution does not involved the `.progress = TRUE` argument that **furrr** implements.  Because **progressr** is more generic and because `.progress = TRUE` only works for certain future backends and produces errors on others, I recommended to stop using `.progress = TRUE` and use the **progressr** package instead.


### BiocParallel::bplapply() - parallel lapply()

Here is an example that uses `bplapply()` of the **[BiocParallel]** package to parallelize on the local machine while at the same time signaling progression updates:

```r
library(BiocParallel)
library(doFuture)
register(DoparParam())  ## BiocParallel parallelizes via %dopar%
registerDoFuture()      ## %dopar% parallelizes via future
plan(multisession)

library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("progress", "beepr")

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- bplapply(xs, function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(6.0-x)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
}

my_fcn(1:5)
# / [================>-----------------------------]  40% x=2
```


### plyr::llply(..., .parallel = TRUE) with doFuture

Here is an example that uses `llply()` of the **[plyr]** package to parallelize on the local machine while at the same time signaling progression updates:

```r
library(plyr)
library(doFuture)
registerDoFuture()      ## %dopar% parallelizes via future
plan(multisession)

library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)
handlers("progress", "beepr")

my_fcn <- function(xs) {
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- llply(xs, function(x, ...) {
    Sys.sleep(6.0-x)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  }, .parallel = TRUE)
}

my_fcn(1:5)
# / [================>-----------------------------]  40% x=2
```

_Note:_ Although **progressr** implements support for using `.progress = "progressr"` with **plyr**, unfortunately, this will _not_ work when using `.parallel = TRUE`.  This is because **plyr** resets `.progress` to the default `"none"` internally regardless how we set `.progress`. See <https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr/issues/70> for details and a hack that works around this limitation.


### Near-live versus buffered progress updates with futures

As of November 2020, there are four types of **future** backends that are known(*) to provide near-live progress updates:

 1. `sequential`,
 2. `multicore`,
 3. `multisession`, and
 4. `cluster` (local and remote)

Here "near-live" means that the progress handlers will report on progress almost immediately when the progress is signaled on the worker.   For all other future backends, the progress updates are only relayed back to the main machine and reported together with the results of the futures.  For instance, if `future_lapply(X, FUN)` chunks up the processing of, say, 100 elements in `X` into eight futures, we will see progress from each of the 100 elements as they are done when using a future backend supporting "near-live" updates, whereas we will only see those updated to be flushed eight times when using any other types of future backends.

(*) Other future backends may gain support for "near-live" progress updating later.  Adding support for those is independent of the **progressr** package.  Feature requests for adding that support should go to those future-backend packages.



## Note of caution - sending progress updates too frequently

Signaling progress updates comes with some overhead.  In situation where we use progress updates, this overhead is typically much smaller than the task we are processing in each step.  However, if the task we iterate over is quick, then the extra time induced by the progress updates might end up dominating the overall processing time.  If that is the case, a simple solution is to only signal progress updates every n:th step.  Here is a version of `slow_sum()` that signals progress every 10:th iteration:
```
slow_sum <- function(x) {
  p <- progressr::progressor(length(x) / 10)
  sum <- 0
  for (kk in seq_along(x)) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    sum <- sum + x[kk]
    if (kk %% 10 == 0) p(message = sprintf("Added %g", x[kk]))
  }
  sum
}
```

The overhead of progress signaling may depend on context.  For example, in parallel processing with near-live progress updates via 'multisession' futures, each progress update is communicated via a socket connections back to the main R session.  These connections might become clogged up if progress updates are too frequent.


## Progress updates in non-interactive mode ("batch mode")

When running R from the command line, R runs in a non-interactive mode
(`interactive()` returns `FALSE`).  The default behavior of **progressr**
is to _not_ report on progress in non-interactive mode.
To reported on progress also then, set R options `progressr.enable` or
environment variable `R_PROGRESSR_ENABLE` to `TRUE`.  For example,

```sh
$ Rscript -e "library(progressr)" -e "with_progress(y <- slow_sum(1:10))"
```
will _not_ report on progress, whereas
```sh
$ export R_PROGRESSR_ENABLE=TRUE
$ Rscript -e "library(progressr)" -e "with_progress(y <- slow_sum(1:10))"
```
will.



## Roadmap

Because this project is under active development, the progressr API is currently kept at a very minimum.  This will allow for the framework and the API to evolve while minimizing the risk for breaking code that depends on it.  The roadmap for developing the API is roughly:

* [x] Provide minimal API for producing progress updates, i.e. `progressor()`, `with_progress()`, `handlers()`

* [x] Add support for global progress handlers removing the need for the user having to specify `with_progress()`, i.e. `handlers(global = TRUE)` and `handlers(global = FALSE)`

* [ ] Make it possible to create a progressor also in the global environment (see 'Known issues' below)

* [ ] Add support for nested progress updates

* [ ] Add API to allow users and package developers to design additional progression handlers

For a more up-to-date view on what features might be added, see <https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr/issues>.


## Appendix

### Known issues

It is not possible to create a progressor in the global environment, e.g. in the the top-level of a script.  It has to be created inside a function, within `with_progress({ ... })`, `local({ ... })`, or a similar construct.  For example, the following:

```r
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

xs <- 1:5
p <- progressor(along = xs)
y <- lapply(xs, function(x) {
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
  p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
  sqrt(x)
})
```

results in an error if tried:

```
Error in progressor(along = xs) : 
  A progressor must not be created in the global environment unless wrapped in a
  with_progress() or without_progress() call. Alternatively, create it inside a
  function or in a local() environment to make sure there is a finite life span
  of the progressor
```

The solution is to wrap it in a `local({ ... })` call, or more explicitly, in a `with_progress({ ... })` call:

```r
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE)

xs <- 1:5
with_progress({
  p <- progressor(along = xs)
  y <- lapply(xs, function(x) {
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    p(sprintf("x=%g", x))
    sqrt(x)
  })
})
#  |====================                               |  40%
```

The main reason for this is to limit the life span of each progressor.  If we created it in the global environment, there is a significant risk it would never finish and block all of the following progressors.


### Under the hood

When using the **progressr** package, progression updates are communicated via R's condition framework, which provides methods for creating, signaling, capturing, muffling, and relaying conditions.  Progression updates are of classes `progression` and `immediateCondition`(\*).  The below figure gives an example how progression conditions are created, signaled, and rendered.

(\*) The `immediateCondition` class of conditions are relayed as soon as possible by the **[future]** framework, which means that progression updates produced in parallel workers are reported to the end user as soon as the main R session have received them.




![](imgs/slow_sum.svg)

_Figure: Sequence diagram illustrating how signaled progression conditions are captured by `with_progress()`, or the global progression handler, and relayed to the two progression handlers 'progress' (a progress bar in the terminal) and 'beepr' (auditory) that the end user has chosen._
